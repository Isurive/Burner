# Shared Contracts

This package contains shared JSON schemas to prevent drift between frontend and backend implementations.

## Schemas

- `userProfile.schema.json` - User profile structure
- `jobRequirement.schema.json` - Job requirement structure
- `applicationPackage.schema.json` - Application package structure
- `alignment.schema.json` - Alignment mapping structure

These schemas serve as the contract between frontend and backend, ensuring consistency.
